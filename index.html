  <h1>EECS 348 Labs</h1>
  <h2>Lab 1</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="slides/lab1.pdf">Slides</a>. Git and GitHub. Learn how to
    create a git repository, add files to it, modify tracked files, and
    push the repository to GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>

    https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405</a>
    for some best practices for organizing your repositories.
  </p>

  <h2>Lab 2</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="slides/lab2.pdf">Slides</a>. Regular expressions and common
    Unix command-line tools. Learn how to write regular expressions, use
    them in tools such as grep, sed, and awk, and how to pipeline commands
    together.
  </p>

  <h2>Lab 3</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="slides/lab3.pdf">Slides</a>. How to compile a C program with multiple source code files using Make.
  </p>
  <h3>Live-coding examples</h3>
  <h4>main.c</h4>
  <p><code>main.c</code> Contains a function named <code>main</code>. Every C program requires one such function as an entry-point into the program. The third line includes the <code>even.h</code> header file with the definition for <code>is_even</code>.
<pre class="code">
<code>#include &ltstdio.h&gt</code>
<code></code>
<code>#include "even.h"</code>
<code></code>
<code>int main() {</code>
<code>  int n = 5;</code>
<code></code>
<code>  if (is_even(n)) {</code>
<code>    printf("%d is even\n", n);</code>
<code>  } else {</code>
<code>    printf("%d is odd\n", n);</code>
<code>  }</code>
<code>}</code>
</code></pre>
<h4>even.c</h4>
<pre class="code">
<code>#include "even.h"</code>
<code></code>
<code>int is_even(int n) {</code>
<code>  if (n % 2 == 0) {</code>
<code>    return 1;</code>
<code>  } else {</code>
<code>    return 0;</code>
<code>  }</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>
<h4>even.h</h4>
<pre class="code">
<code>#ifndef __EVEN_H__</code>
<code>#define __EVEN_H__</code>
<code></code>
<code>int is_even(int n);</code>
<code></code>
<code>#endif /* __EVEN_H__ */</code>
</pre>
<h4>Sequence of commands to create an executable</h4>
<p>To compile the two .c files into an executable, I ran this sequence of commands to create the file <code>program</code> which can then be run with: <code>$ ./program</code>.</p>
<code><pre>gcc even.c -c         # -c compiles a .o object
gcc main.c -c
gcc main.o even.o -o program  # -o compiles an executable
</code></pre>
  <h2>Lab 4</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="slides/lab4.pdf">Slides</a>. Connecting to the cycle machines using SSH. 
    Introduction to web programming with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
  </p>
  <h3>Uploading your website</h3>
  <p>To put your website on your people page&mdash;<em>e.g.</em>, mine is
  <a href="https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~h054w684">https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~h054w684</a> and yours
  will replace the <code>h054w684</code> part of the URL with your first-initial last-initial
  ID&mdash;you will have to connect to the cycle servers, or get on a lab machine. From there, under
  your home directory you should have a directory named <code>public_html</code>. All of the source
  code for your website must be placed in there to be visible. You should have a file named
  <code>index.html</code>, which will be the first HTML page that is displayed when you navigate to
  your URL. From there, you should link to the other practice pages.</p>

  <h3>Using GitHub to sync your code and your website</h3>
  <p>The lab submission wants you to provide a link to a GitHub repository with your website's source
  code, as well as a link to your people website. A good workflow for this assignment would be to develop your
  website on your local machine in a git repository that you push to GitHub, and to clone that repository
  on the cycle server in the <code>public_html</code> directory to keep your code synced up.
  For help with the first step of putting your code on GitHub, review the slides for Lab 1.</p>

  <p>For the step of cloning your repository on your lab machine, the way I found that works best is to 
  rename your <code>public_html</code> directory on the cycle server by running:</p>

  <code><pre>$ mv public_html public_html2</pre></code>

  <p>This ensures that if you mess something up, you can recover the original folder. Next, assuming
  you have already created your git repository, you can now clone it on the lab machine, but you will
  need the folder the repository is cloned into to be named <code>public_html</code>. You can set the
  name of the folder that git clones into with:</p>

  <code><pre>$ git clone &ltYOUR REPOSITORY URL&gt public_html</pre></code>

  <p>Now you have git repositories on both your local machine and the cycle server, and you will be able
  to develop locally, push changes to GitHub, and later connect to the cycle machine to pull those changes
  to have them actually be reflected on your people page.</p>

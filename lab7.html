    <h2>Pointers and debugging SEGFAULT</h2>
    <p>
      A value, such as a number or the contents of a struct, can have one variable that it is assigned to, and it can have any number of pointers referring to it.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">int x = 100; /* create a int variable. this holds a `value` */
int *xp; /* create a variable that can point to an int. this `points` to a value */
xp = &x; /* make `xp` point to `x` by getting `x`'s memory address with the & operator */
*xp = 5; /* dereference `xp` with * and set its contents to 5. this sets x = 5. */

/* Unlike in Python, assigning one struct to another creates a copy, for the
 * reason given above */
struct Data d1;
d1.value = 20;
struct Data d2 = d1;

/* Modifying d2 does not change d1 */
d2.value = 50;
assert(d1.value != 50);

/* A pointer refers to the struct in memory, and can modify it by dereferencing,
   just like how `xp` modifies `x`. Use the -> operator to modify a struct ptr */
struct Data *dptr = &d1;
dptr->value = 50;
assert(d1.value == 50);</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      A pointer can be a single object, or it can be an array of objects.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">/* malloc gives us a memory address that is big enough to hold 3 integers.
 * the argument to malloc is the bytes of memory to alloc, which we can
 * calculate as 3 times the size of an int */
int *x = malloc(3 * sizeof int);
x[0] = 5;
x[1] = 6;
x[2] = 7;

/* whenever we allocate memory we should try to free it: */
free(x);
x = NULL; /* the address given to x by malloc is no longer valid so set it to NULL */

/* strings have always been just arrays of `char` */
char *string = "Hello, world!"
/* string[0] == 'H' */</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      A very common use-case for pointers is passing a struct to a function that we may want the function to modify.
      The default behavior in C when a struct is passed as a parameter is to copy the struct. This means if we change
      the struct inside a function, the struct outside the function won't have been modified. If we pass a pointer to
      the struct instead, then the function will modify the struct itself. That's why I pass a pointer to <code>Array</code>
      in the <code>insert_array</code> function for assignment 4. The <code>Data</code> struct can be passed as a value
      because it isn't modified by the function.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">void insert_array(struct Array *array, struct Data data) {
        if (array == NULL) {
            /* some error message about the array being uninitialized */
            return;
        }
        if (array->length == 64) {
            /* handle the case where we've overfilled the array */
        } else {
            int index = array->length;
            array->array[index] = data;
            array->length += 1;
        }
    }</code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Using an address sanitizer</h3>
    <p>
      We can catch many pointer errors in our programs if we use an address sanitizer. This is a library we build into
      our program to perform some checks every time we access memory, either through a pointer directly, or through an
      array index, which is really just accessing a pointer at an offset under the hood. For example, we might have a
      pointer that we don't actually make point to anything. C will put a random value into it, and when we try to access
      it, that random value will likely not point to anything in our program so the OS will kill it and report a SEGFAULT
      (Segmentation fault).
    </p>
    <p>
      The OS makes sure any memory accesses our program makes actually are to addresses allocated to the program. If we
      try to access any memory whatsoever, the OS kills our program to protect the integrity of the system. Otherwise you
      could have processes accidentally changing the memory of other processes and causing all sorts of errors. So, for example:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-c">/* create an integer pointer and try to dereference it */
int *x;
*x = 500; /* `x` doesn't point to anything in the program so SEGFAULT! */
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      We create an integer pointer and then immediately dereference it and set its contents to <code>500</code>. Because the
      memory address in the pointer is random, it doesn't point into our process so the OS kills it with a SEGFAULT. We could
      also directly set the memory address of a pointer like:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">
/* a pointer is just a number, so it's valid to cast a number to a pointer right? */
*(char*) 0 = '\0'; /* SEGFAULT! */
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      And the same thing will most likely happen. Both of these examples will just cause the program to crash with no useful
      debugging information. We can give ourselves more to work with if we compile our code with the address sanitizer that
      comes with <code>gcc</code> and <code>clang</code> (on macOS) like so:
    </p>
    <pre>
      gcc program.c -fsanitize=address -g -o program
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here I use the <code>-fsanitize=address</code> compiler flag to link the address sanitizer, and the <code>-g</code> flag
      to build debugging information into my executable. When compile and run the code above with the address sanitizer, rather
      than a SEGFAULT message, we get a detailed report about where the buggy pointer dereference occurred.
    </p>
    <pre>

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV ex.c:5 in main
==28220==ABORTING
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here the useful part is the line telling us that the dereference occurred in <code>example.c</code> at line 5. It's usually
      enough to go back to that line and then trace where the pointer came from and what values it possibly could have
      to be able to diagnose the issue. In this case it's obvious because we're initializing the pointer to zero and then dereferencing
      it, but in real code it's most likely the pointer was never set to a value and then passed to a function or into a struct.

    <h2>CMake and GitHub Action setup</h2>
    <p>
      The following is documentation for how the tests are set up with CMake and ran with GitHub Actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> at the root of the repository creates a library target named <code>libassignment</code>
      of all source files not containing the <code>main</code> function. This way any functions other than <code>main</code> are
      available to the executable made for running the unit tests in the <code>tests/</code> folder by linking to <code>libassignment</code>.

      It also adds <code>tests/</code> as a subdirectory so that when CMake is run, it will look in that directory for more build instructions.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-cmake">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
project(EECS348-Lab-7)

if (CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL "3.24.0")
    cmake_policy(SET CMP0135 NEW)
endif()

file(GLOB src *.c *.cpp)
list(FILTER src EXCLUDE REGEX ".*main\\.c(c|pp|xx)?")
add_subdirectory(tests)
add_library(assignment ${src})</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> in <code>tests/</code> downloads the <code>googletest</code> repository and compiles it.
        It then compiles an executable with unit tests and links to <code>libassignment</code> to build your functions into the tests.
        The file mostly follows the example in <a href="https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html">https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html</a>.

  The workflow is found in <code>.github/workflows/gtest.yml</code>. It is triggered by any pushes to the <code>main</code> branch of your
  repository. Under <code>jobs</code> is the <code>test</code> job. It defines Ubuntu Linux as the environment to be ran in, and lists the
  steps to building and running googletest. Under the job named <code>Build googletest</code> are <code>cmake</code> instructions to execute the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files.
  Under the job named <code>Run googletest</code> is an export command to set the environment variable <code>GTEST_COLOR</code> to on, and then to change directory into
  the build directory and run the tests.

      An example of a <emph>failing</emph> job run can be found at <a href="https://github.com/hrhwilliams/EECS348_Lab-7-template/actions/runs/13823097362/job/38672730358">https://github.com/hrhwilliams/EECS348_Lab-7-template/actions/runs/13823097362/job/38672730358</a>. There,
      if you look at the <code>Build googletest</code> step you can see a log reporting why the build failed. If you look at lines 36-38, and 40-43, you can see the build tool reports undefined
      references to all of the functions the test file wants to call, because none of them are defined yet in any of the <code>.c</code> files in the template.

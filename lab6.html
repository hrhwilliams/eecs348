    <p>
      Here I've tried to compile some advice for writing assignment 4. If you need help compiling your project, refer back to <a href="lab3.html">lab 3</a> 
      where I've included a Makefile example now that the lab is over.

    <h3>Handling data in C</h3>
    <p>
      C doesn't come with any built-in data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, like Python does. Instead if we want the
      functionality of one of these from Python we'll have to build it ourselves. At the start, all C gives us to work with are
      basic types such as: <code>int</code>, <code>char</code> and <code>float</code>; pointers; structs; and static arrays. If
      we want a complex data type with multiple values, like a class with member variables, we can create a struct. The biggest
      difference is here we can't associate member functions with structs like we can with classes in Python.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">struct Data {
    char *name;
    int length;
    float direction;
};

/* create one of our structs and set values inside it with the `.` operator */
struct Data my_data;
my_data.name = "Hello";
my_data.length = 5;
my_data.direction = 3.1415f;</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      We can also create a static, fixed-size array of structs like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">struct Data my_array[16];
my_array[0] = my_data; /* copy the values of `my_data` into the first element */
my_array[1].name = "World"; /* modify the second element in-place */
my_array[1].length = 5;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Unlike in Python, we cannot grow or shrink this array, but we can mimic that behavior by starting with a large array and keeping an index to the last
      element we've modified. Because the array and its length are associated we bundle them together in a struct:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">struct Array {
    struct Data array[64];
    int length;
};</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Then it would be a good idea to define how the array is used in a function, so that we don't have to manually adjust the <code>length</code>.
    </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-c">void insert_array(struct Array *array, struct Data data) {
    if (array->length == 64) {
        /* handle the case where we've overfilled the array */
    } else {
        int index = array->length;
        array->array[index] = data;
        array->length += 1;
    }
}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Notice how here I pass the array as a pointer, because I want to modify that specific array. Otherwise this would create a new array in the function
        and not modify it outside of the function like I want. I also use the arrow operator <code>-></code> rather than the dot operator to access member
        variables of <code>array</code> through the pointer.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading strings</h3>
      <p>
      To read input from a file in C, we can use the <code>fread</code> function. By the way, for all of the functions mentioned here, if you are on Linux or macOS
      you can type the command <code>man &lt;function&gt;</code> into your terminal to get a help page about that specific function. We can grab the first line of
      our input with the following code:
    </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-c">char buffer[512];

/* "r" here means: open the file in read mode */
FILE *fp = fopen("input.txt", "r"); 

/* fgets will read up to the first newline or *
 * the end of the file, whichever comes first */
char *line = fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer, fp);</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      Here we allocate an array of characters for the text to be read into, named creatively <code>buffer</code>. We make it 512 characters long, which should be
      sufficient for the input files you'll be working with. Next we open <code>input.txt</code> by calling <code>fopen</code>, which returns a pointer to the
      file handle. So far, this is exactly equivalent to <code>with open("input.txt", "r") as file:</code> in Python. The last line in this block reads a line
      from the input file and stores it in the character pointer <code>line</code>. The <code>fgets</code> function takes as arguments: our buffer, its length that we get
      with the keyword <code>sizeof</code>, and the file handle pointer <code>fp</code> at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      This just grabs the first line for us, and we want to be able to read the entire input file. We can do this by calling <code>fgets</code> in a loop until it
      returns <code>NULL</code>, which means it has ran into the end of the file.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">char buffer[512];
FILE *fp = fopen(filename, "r");
char *line = fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer, fp);

while (line != NULL) { /* check if we're done reading */
    process_line(line);
    line = fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer, fp) /* get the next input line */
}</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here we use a while-loop. We check if <code>line</code> is <code>NULL</code>
      in each iteration, and if not, we pass it along to <code>process_input</code> and grab the next line. This should be enough to read the input, just keep
      in mind that each line will have a newline character at the end.
    </p>
    <h3>Parsing strings</h3>
    <p>
      In Python, if you are given a string of comma-delimited values, you can simply call <code class="language-python">string.split(",")</code> to get
      a list of those values. In C, an equivalent is the function <code class="language-c">strtok</code>. Its usage is a bit odd to get used to at first.
      If we have the string <code>"Peer,Can you help me on this?,12-01-2024"</code> from the input file, we want to split it up by comma.
      To do this with <code class="language-c">strtok</code>, we do:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-c">/* Small technicality: strtok can't modify a hard-coded string,
 * so we create one it can modify with strdup. */
const char *line = "Peer,Can you help me on this?,12-01-2024";
char *input = strdup(line);

char *sender = strtok(input, ",");
char *subject = strtok(NULL, ",");
char *date = strtok(NULL, ",");</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The first call takes the input string and the delimiter, the <code>","</code>, and returns the part of the string up to the first instance of the delimiter
      character. What is really going on is: In C, a string is just an array of characters of any length. To know when a string ends, there is always a <code>'\0'</code>
      character at the end of the array, and every string processing function in C knows to stop when it hits this character. So <code>strtok</code> looks for the
      first instance of the delimiter it sees, replaces it with a <code>'\0'</code>, and returns a pointer to the start of the string.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second call to <code>strtok</code> takes <code>NULL</code> rather than the input string again, because the function saves its location in the string. Otherwise
      it would start at the beginning again, but this time find the <code>'\0'</code> character that it replaced before and stop, which returns nothing. So the second line
      starts after the character it replaced, and does the same thing, replacing the second comma with a <code>'\0'</code> and returning a pointer to the string after the
      first comma.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <code>strtok</code> is finished, it will return <code>NULL</code>, or it may also return <code>NULL</code> if there are any errors in its input, so it is important to check that
      it is returning strings when you expect strings, and <code>NULL</code> when you expect it to be done. So after the lines above, you could put:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code class="language-c">if (sender == NULL || subject == NULL || date == NULL) {
    printf("[Error] One of the parsed strings is NULL\n");
}

if (strtok(NULL, ",") != NULL) {
    printf("[Error] Expected strtok to return NULL when finished processing input\n");
}</code>
    </pre>
